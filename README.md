# Time Series Prediction in Welding Process Control

This project was aimed at forecasting the voltage level of welding guns at a FCA production plant using time series analysis. The analysis was performed using both traditional and Machine Learning models. The forecasted value of voltage could be used for anomaly detection, i.e. for real-time monitoring of welding enabling higher efficiency and better quality of product.
